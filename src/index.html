        <p>Since 1906 “Queensland Rum” is defined by Australian law as a spirit of at least 37% ABV obtained by the distillation in Queensland and maturation in Queensland by storage in wood for at least 2 years of a fermented liquor derived from the products of sugar cane, being distillation carried out in such a manner that the spirit possesses the taste, aroma and other characteristics generally attributed to rum. Queensland Rum is most commonly made from molasses but can also be made from sugar cane juice, sugar cane syrup and sugar.</p>

          <p>Since July 1867 rum distilled from Queensland sugar cane is to many Australian’s the definitive taste of Queensland but as consumers preferences and education are evolving so is Queensland rum. Queensland rum producers are sparing no effort to produce and mature rums that challenge long held beliefs that imported rums are always better. The Queensland Rum Renaissance is well and truly a thing! <span class="quote end">”</span></p>

        <h2 class="panel-title mt-n4 mb-5">Our Sugar</h2> 

        <p>Sugarcane was brought to Australia in 1788 on the ships of the First Fleet. It was not immediately successful even though attempts were still being made more than thirty years later to grow sugarcane commercially at Port Macquarie in NSW. Captain Louis Hope and John Buhot established the first viable Australian cane plantation at Ormiston near Brisbane in 1862. Two years later Hope started up the first commercial sugar mill.</p>
